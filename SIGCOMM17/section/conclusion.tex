\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\nfactor~is an NFV system built using the distributed actor model, to achieve transparent resilience, high scalability and high packet processing efficiency. It advocates a novel per-flow micro execution principle, to provide a dedicated service chain service for each individual flow, while guaranteeing low overhead and high performance. \nfactor~includes a set of APIs for NFs to enforce clear separation of state and processing logic, as well as carefully designed runtimes and virtual switches that carry out prompt flow migration, replication and scaling, largely among themselves. We have implemented the prototype \nfactor~system and open-sourced the project \cite{projectcode}. Our experiments under intensive workload exhibit good scalability, high packet processing speed, as well as fast flow migration and failure recovery with \nfactor.
